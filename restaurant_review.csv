R M.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Oct 11, 2023","I'm a local in this neighborhood and was happy to see the arrival of new food options beyond pizza/desserts... but the prices are absurd for what is essentially a glorified food court (that charges & expects you to tip like you're in a sit down restaurant). And the crowds/ongoing noise have tarnished what used to be a lovely, quaint block.It's purely for tourists and influencers doing a one time visit to enjoy some nearby waterfront views. You'll get a decent variety at least."
Bishal B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 7, 2023","Clinton St. Baking CompanyBlueberry Pancakes: Some of the best pancakes I've ever tasted. They were delightfully soft on the inside with a perfect texture on the outside.Service: Be prepared for a busy crowd, especially during peak hours, which might result in longer wait times for your order.Ambiance: Clinton St. Baking Company is part of the Time Out Market, so you may need to exercise patience while waiting for available seats."
Harris P.,"Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"Sep 29, 2023","About 10 minutes walk from subway station.The day I visited was raining (really bad) so they closed the outdoor seating (first and fifth floor). I'm pretty sure the view of Manhattan city line and the bridge will be super nice if there's no rain.Most of food located in first floor, a lot of seating indoor and outdoor (connected to the waterfront), fifth floor has bar and pizza, sushi, cozy coach seating indoor plus great view outdoor patio seatings."
Jennifer R.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Sep 23, 2023","The Timeout Market is a gem for anyone looking to satisfy their cravings. With its diverse lineup of food options, it's paradise under one roof. What's more, you can step outside to capture stunning photos, taking in the breathtaking view of the bridge.During my visit to Timeout Market New York, my partner and I had the pleasure of eating at Bark Barbecue, and we were absolutely smitten by the flavors.

Katey G.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Jul 16, 2023","Timeout Market continues to be a great destination in the Dumbo area.I do love the diversity of Time Out Market. Weather you want Indian, pancakes, pasta, or fried chicken - you can find it here.Most recently I got a pizza from Fornino, which is kind of f hidden on the top floor (there's also a little balcony rooftop that should not be missed). They had a seasonal corn pizza on the menu which was delicious - I really loved it. I also got the arancini which were disappointing, the aborillo rice inside was still crunchy :/ I believe they used to be served with a truffle aioli which I miss.What's cool about Time Out is that you can pickup food and sit at one of their two bars and order cocktails. We sat at the bar counter and enjoyed our food."
Melissa R.,"Claremont, CA",5 star rating,"Aug 12, 2023","A couple of friends and I visited New York earlier this year to celebrate my birthday. One of my friends had never been to NY before, so we decided she needed to see the Brooklyn Bridge, one of my favorite landmarks of the city. After a terrible rideshare driver decided not to leave us on the Manhattan side and instead dumped us off on the Brooklyn side, we decided to hang out in Brooklyn for a while. (Side note, I love Brooklyn, but we were short on time, so hanging out in Brooklyn wasn't part of the original itinerary, and we just wanted to walk on thr bridge from the Manhattan side, leaving it open to go to Brooklyn, only if we had time to spare.)Anyway, while we were stranded in Brooklyn trying to figure out the best way back, I stumbled upon Timeout Market. Being a lover of food halls, I dragged my friends inside to check it out, and we are so glad we did!I loved the amazing view of both bridges from their rooftop, the fact that you can enjoy a nice cocktail with this lovely view, and the variety of eateries! We decided to have lunch there, with each of us trying food from different vendors, and we were all pleased. I definitely plan to return the next time I visit Brooklyn!"
Ben L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 22, 2023",Lovely food court to come and spend a few hours in. Their rooftop is amazing. Unfortunately it was packed with foreigners so it's not the real New York vibe but aside from that it's a nice place to hang out in.
Andrea U.,"Boynton Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Aug 26, 2023","The market has really expanded into a huge indoor, outdoor and rooftop food hall. Everything imaginable from liquor to ice cream, sushi, barbecue... Lots of clean seating, helpful staff, and endless views of Manhattan and the Hudson River."
Anna P.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Sep 3, 2023","This is now my favorite food hall in NYC! I absolutely love all the outdoor seating options and the quality of the vendors there. We started off with tofu pad Thai from Wayla, which was a 10/10. It was full of flavor and the noodles were fantastic.Then we had blueberry pancakes from Clinton Street Baking Co. I'm not exaggerating when I say these were the best pancakes I have had in my life. Views from both the rooftop and outdoor seating on the main level are epic. Such an amazing way to enjoy the waterfront. I can't wait to return and try more things. Wheelchair access: no problem with entry from outside. There are indoor and outdoor elevators you can take to reach the rooftop level. The rooftop has one step down to the seating area but there is a gate on the side of the seating that a manager can unlock for wheelchair access. It requires asking people to move tables. Very poorly thought through as they could have either made the main entrance ramped or moved the tables to make area by the gate more accessible and left the gate open. One shouldn't have to wait for management to show up to simply access a seating area while disabled. I did not use the bathrooms so not sure of their accessibility."
Tyler L.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Jun 1, 2023","While exploring Brooklyn Bridge Park, we decided to check out the Time Out Market for the first time. It is a food court that is inside the historic Empire Stores Building, an old warehouse. While the building itself is impressive, the food court is nothing unique. It is very similar in selection and atmosphere to other recent food courts like Gotham West Market.The food court area is actually smaller than I expected given the size of the building. There is still a decent selection of various cuisines like Mexican, ramen, steaks, bagels, Indian and more. This is something I'd only go to if was a visitor to Brooklyn Bridge Park, as that area is relatively empty. For eats, I'd rather be at the more impressive and larger Chelsea Market than here."

Monica D.,"Hackensack, NJ",4 star rating,"Oct 25, 2023","My friend and I were trying to go for the better part of two years end I finally made it there. We could not get a reservation so we got there about a half hour before it opened on a Sunday and they gave us a table with no issue.Of course the top thing there is the tie-dyed pie but I also wanted to try the honey pie and I'm so happy I did because it turned out to be my favorite thing. We shared arugula salad, meatballs, pizza and baked clams. Service was attentive and polite. A must visit."
Avery D.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 23, 2023","Had a really good meal here! Came with friends and we split a Caesar salad, vodka pasta, and tie dye pizza. The pizza was very good! Thin crust, nice flavors. The pasta was good as well. Not the strongest vodka flavor I've ever had, but I liked that. And the Caesar was good too. Classic caesar salad.They brought bread for the table which was sooo fluffy and delicious.It's a bit of a noisy atmosphere but great vibes inside."
Isabella T.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 21, 2023","Came back to Rubirosa with my parents for lunch on a Friday at 1:15pm. Even for lunch time, I suggest you try to get a reservation since this place is incredibly busy for a weekday lunch and all tables were full. We were seated promptly in the very back section of the restaurant (which I did not even know existed?) that is tucked away and a little bit more quiet than the entrance, which I appreciated. Service this time left me a little bit unimpressed which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. Our server felt a little dry and curt, less patient that prior times I've been here, and also forgot one of the items we ordered. Not sure if it's because we were in the very back but it made us feel like the service was less attentive than before. We split a few items on the menu which were delicious and made the trip worth it: Tie-Dye Pizza: now I understand why this is one of their most popular items. Even though I'm a pretty traditional gal with pizza, this pie was dreamy. First of all, the aesthetics are unmatched: the pizza is vibrantly colored at its base and then gets a perfect swirl of pesto right in front of you at the table. It also has an insanely thin crust that just looked perfectly crispy and elegant. The flavors were also really balanced. I loved the combination of having both tomato and vodka sauce since there was a nice sweet and tangy/more acidic contrast that was very nicely tied together by the creamy and salty mozzarella. The pesto was super subtle and was the perfect complement without being overpowering. The crust was sooo crispy and the slices were so thin! It was delicious... I will definitely be ordering this whenever I come back in the future. Lumanche Alla Vodka: my stepdad loves vodka pasta so we had to order this dish. Both my parents were blown away by this dish and really loved the sauce. I personally thought it was good but not any better than at other places in Little Italy. The pasta was not as Al dente as I would have liked and I felt like the sauce lacked some punch. However my family was very happy which is what mattered to me more since this is the dish they were most excited to have. They both said they liked this better than the pizza (possible pasta bias here). Tiramisu: their desserts have never disappointed and this was the best one I've tried on their menu so far! The slice of tiramisu is generous, the mascarpone blend is mildly sweet but not overpowering, perfectly creamy, and it's sandwiched between perfectly moist lady fingers that were not soggy at all. The flavor of the coffee was perfect! Loved this dessert and would order again in a heartbeat.Overall, I had a good experience here! The food was still fantastic and if you are able to get a reservation the week before, I think it's well worth it. Prices are steeper than other places you can find in the city but the ingredients they use are very high quality and the ambiance is very nice-- it's also just a NYC classic that everyone should try at least once. Service was a little disappointing this time around but I've had good experiences before so it could have been just a random blip. I will definitely be coming back in the future for more delicious pizza!"
Lily M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 17, 2023","We did not have a reservation but wanted to check Rubirosa out because we had heard great things. We arrived around 6:45 on a Sunday night and were told the wait for two was 2.5 hours. We decided to check out other bars in the area while we were waiting,and our wait only ended up being 1 hour! We got an arugula salad to start. It was very dark so hard to take pictures without either the flash or them turning up blurry. For pizza you can do split halves, so one side we did the tie dye which has a pesto drizzle. That was one was delicious, it's a great staple that I would encourage everyone to try! For the other half we got the san gennaro which had sausage. It was on the back of the menu and seemed like a special or limited time so we weee glad we could get it in the half potion. Service was very quick and the food came out fast. There is only one bathroom in the whole restaurant so that can take a while if there was a line. Rubirosa is definitely the place to go and if you can't get a reservation try your luck with a walk in!"
Ryan P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 16, 2023","We came in with a group of 8 on a Friday night with no reservation. Not exactly the easiest scenario to get a table at a restaurant on nearly every list of top spots in NYC, but alas we were seated about an hour after putting our name down!That's the move here. Come early, put your name down, and grab a drink at one of the many great bars nearby. Once seated, buckle in for a wonderful experience. Ask your waiter for their favorite pizza variation. They all have their own perspectives and it's great to get an experts thoughts.We got the tye die pie which did not disappoint, but what I was most impressed by were the pastas. No one talks about how great they are here -- get them!"
Celine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"Oct 10, 2023","Rubirosa has great reviews everywhere and it was so difficult to book a table during weekends that we decided to eat here on a random weekday. The restaurant is super crowded and loud. Service was great. The staff was efficient and the guy working the bar was extremely friendly. He let me sample the alcoholic slushie before I ordered it. Thank god because it was not very good lol.As for food, I thought they were just okay. My expectations were probably too high for what reality has to offer.- Half tie dye and half Bianca (3/5): Meh, super underwhelming and bland. Tie dye pizza was oily from the pesto sauce. Bianca was dry and flavorless even with the cheese and bits of garlic. Just seemed like overall seasoning was missing.- Mushroom Campanelle (4/5): Pretty delicious pasta dish with lots of mushroom, sofrito, and garlic cream. Individual portion was a bit small."
Summer O.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5 star rating,"Oct 17, 2023","Make sure you have a reservation, or stop-in to get your name on the list and check out Little Italy and/or the local church. We ordered the house red wine (which is their own label), a salad to share as a starter, meatballs and calamari as a first course, and a Rubirosa Surprene pizza as a second course. We enjoyed everything. People choose Rubirosa because of their name and legacy in NYC pizza. They did not disappoint. The restaurant is very narrow, but long. The tables are packed in. It's everything I think of when I think NY Italian restaurant. I think family, togetherness, closeness. It was hopping, and I liked it like that."
Nicole K.,"Bellerose, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 17, 2023","Rubirosa is a fantastic, classic NY establishment. The inside is small- a reservation is required. The reservation window opens on resy a week before. Once inside the ambiance is cozy and intimate. The menu includes appetizers, salads, pasta dishes and pizza. There's a nice drink menu too.We had the arugula salad which was nicely dressed and flavorful. Homemade mozzarella sticks are a great treat. They are fried to perfection. For our main lunch we had the infamous Tie Dye pie. A delicious vodka sauced based pie with a swirl of pesto! Definitely make your way here when in the area."
Darian B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 11, 2023","LOVED this restaurant! Went for drinks and apps and left with a whole pie to take home. It was busy, but we got lucky walking in to get a table without a wait.We ordered a few things to share, but the mushroom pasta takes the cake - it was recommended by our serve (Alicia) and she nailed it! It was different and amazing and I would definitely order it again.Alicia was such a great serve - I would request to have her if/when I go back. The pizza takeout was delish and heated up perfectly in the oven. SO good! We got a dessert platter to share - the small is massive! She tried to warn us, and while it was huge it was also delish. I am not a cannoli girl and these were GREAT."
Kelley S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Oct 2, 2023","I really liked this place! I saw some of their pizzas on Instagram and had to try. I really liked the vibe of the restaurant, we sat outdoors and we happened to be there when there was this festival so it was really cool to see all that around while we were eating. Their selection of pizzas and pastas are diverse but not overwhelming. The shrimp papparadelle we got was really good. And the half honey pig half tie dye pizza was really good. The hot honey on the honey pig worked so well with the saltiness of the meat. I would definitely come back, the only thing was the lack of service, but also with the hectic street fair and it being a weekend I understand the lack of service."

Nicolas L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 20, 2023","The place is very casual but it's got a good amount of seating. It was very pretty empty when we went but the atmosphere was relatively pleasant and allowed for easy conversation. The service was a not great. Our server seemed very disinterested in serving us and like he wanted to go home. However he was still easy to get attention of and was very quick with our order. The food was quite good. It's not my favorite food in the world but if you love south East Asian curries and dishes, it's a great option. I would definitely consider going here next time I'm in the mood for some Thai, Malay, or Vietnamese food. Definitely worth checking out!"

I have eaten not-so-good food for $5 to $7 more than they charge for an entree dish here. We ordered the vegetarian clay-pot curry and veg pad thai. Nothing exceptional about the food, but not bad. Dont go to this place for ambience, it's a mom and pop shop for some hot tasty food. Definitely don't mind swinging by again some day."
Athena C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4 star rating,"Oct 7, 2023","Wow I cannot believe I was here again after an almost a decade away and the owner remembered me from my East Village days when his place was a dumpling joint. The last memory I had was coming here during the landing of the infamous hurricane Sandy and he was the only one who opened his place in the area! Years later, he is still hustling and selling affordable Asian food to the neighborhood. It was so good to see his place thrive and me and my friends had a great time trying out different dishes. We didn't even really order the food and they just came upon his recommendations! New York always makes me smile knowing the small business owners keep her strong and thriving. Don't miss out this friendly and delicious Asian eatery."

We ordered two Thai tea asked for less ice/sugar, but usually drinks are prefix  so they added more milk for us which helped a little but still a bit too sweet for me.

And super hard (over fried). We also got the soft shell crab which came with a super sweet sauce and wasn't seasoned. They were able to switch us out for the spicy chicken tho, it was spicy but super salty and soggy. Come here for the drinks and vibes only."

Simon P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 23, 2023","We were a table of 5 in this modern Chinese restaurant and bar on a saturday evening. It is a dimmed light cozy setting with some old Chinese inspired decors. The table is a bit small for 5 people so we decided to get drinks and appetizers first before getting the mains. The cocktails are all Chinese ingredients inspired and have a good range of strong to weak ones with different liquor bases. I particularly liked the Rice Gorg and HK Milk Punch. The chicken wings were really flavourful and tender, a little bit spicy that helps elevated the flavours. The beef skewers are extremely juicy and tender as well. Overall we enjoyed almost all the drinks and dishes we ordered, and definitely feeling coming back for more in the future!"
Kevin L.,"Westbury, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 4, 2023","I came for my birthday because I wanted some Szechuan food. The moment you walk in, you get transported back to 1930s Shanghai. The decor is beautiful since I think Chinese interior designs from 1930 are amazing. The place is small so you do feel very close to your neighbors.The alcohol list is very unique and highly recommend trying out their cocktails. I love that it is a nice Asian & Western fusion and there are liquors that I've never heard of before. Definitely worth getting one or two a try!We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and all of them were amazing. My favorite was the Chairman's Pork Belly, but my friend likes the Truffle Mushroom Salad. The Changsha Spiced Chicken is ma-la, definitely more on the numbing your tongue side than being spicy. I highly recommend that if you like spicy food.Our waitress Tsering is the cutest. She kept on checking up on us and has a wonderful personality. We chit-chatted quite a bit, in between her managing her tables. Why you want to go:1. Beautiful ambiance, great for date night or just to hang out with friends2. Food is good (and they come quick). I love tapas style as everyone get to try different things3. Cocktails are super unique4. Tsering!Why you want to skip:1. Small place. It feels claustrophobic. Not ideal for large groups or plus sizes2. Time limit. I feel like 90 mins feels rush. We didn't even get to look at desserts."

Grace L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 17, 2023","When in NYC, You have to get pizza! One of my favorite pizza place in NYC is Julianas! I went with my Husband and got a large half white and half margherita and a bottle of wine. It was enough for two BUT if we were super hungry, we would love ordered another small pie or a side! Also do not be fooled by the lines - they move pretty quickly. It looked long so we were going to head to another place but we ended up waiting only 15 minues or so. Highly recommend!! Also, They need give Jamal a raise - He was our server and honestly he made Julianas 200% better. His service and his smile was excellent!"
Lena S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 13, 2023","There is alway a line outside to get in. Luckily it was moving relatively fast. There is not much space inside or outside.

Sandy D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Sep 28, 2023","So delicious a guy was even broadcasting his meal live when we were there!The place was super packed, even on a weeknight. But we luckily beat the rush for a table of 2. For the Classics, you can mix and match. So we went with the Medium Half Margherita Half White Pizza ($25.50), with sausage and fennel (+$6) as toppings for the White pizza. The pizza came super quick. I don't think it came extremely hot unfortunately. Both were great, but I prefer the classic tomato base, especially when the tomato sauce tasted so fresh! Both had an easy to eat, slightly crispy crust. Like all pizza pies, the heat beats us before we finish, and we're left with cold pizza at the end. I really wish we could just pop them in the oven again! The toppings are pricey, but from trying the sausage and fennel which were delicious, I think they could be worth adding in. Check this notable place out whenever you're in the area!"
K I.,"Yorba Linda, CA",5 star rating,"Oct 29, 2023","Came here twice during our vk, it was that good. More in the craft pizza category than classic, the pizza delivered. Order ""well done"" for a crispy crust. We got sausage the first time and the white pie with sweet onions the second, both are a must. Their vanilla egg cream is out of control, so is their root-beer float. Cappuccino on point. Excellent service. There is always a line 10-20 min but worth it. Super cute on the inside, the waitstaff does not make you feel rushed in the slightest. Loveeeee"
Gwen P.,"Yonkers, NY",4 star rating,"Sep 2, 2023","Awesome place. Husband, his family from Italy (3), and I arrived at 3:50ish to a line waiting for the 4:00 reopening of the restaurant. Fate wanted us to get seated during the first wave of crowd in the evening because it grew as the minutes went by and even after we finished our zas and left the perimeter. The place was very bustling even as we waited to get in. It got very crowded very quick, but it was handled well, efficiently, and the guy doing the head counts did a great job sitting us and everyone else. Interesting to know the history of Juliana's and the next door Grimaldi's! (Someone wrote it out down here and you can google as well). I went to Grimaldi's ten years ago with cousins so had to try this 4.5star-er obviously and ask what the Italian family thought of NY style pizza lmao. They loved it! There's definitely that char taste that's included that someone here wrote about that will or will not be your cup of tea. Personally, I don't care much for the wood oven taste, but it's appreciated when I do come across such a place. The tartness of the tomato sauce on the margherita was *chef's kiss*, and so was the not tomatoey at all-scallion pancetta no. 1. They're both equally tasty to me.I do gotta say it's easy to get thirsty when you're chomping down delicious pizza. I know it's Brooklyn, and the sodas are a little more special because they're the ones that are imported (or well at least I hope they are) and come in bottles, but I am still so dehydrated after spending that much on a drink. ($4-$5) Can y'all like. Get generic soda so this isn't a problem? Hehe. Just kidding. Be quenched with a nice icy tap if you're a little frugal like me."
Jessica W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"Oct 9, 2023","Juliana's Pizza had a line out their door before their doors open for the evening, which we stood in line for. Even though we only wanted take out we still stood in line. The line moved relatively quickly though. Unfortunately, they do not sell by the slice and only per pie. They also do not have pepperoni pizza, but you can add-on pepperoni to an existing pizza, so that's what we did. We got a Margherita pizza with pepperonis and a side of meatballs. Honestly, for the size of the pizza relative to how much we paid (Over $20!), I was kind of disappointed. They could have definitely put more pepperonis too, they really skimped out on it. The pizza tasted like a normal NYC margherita pizza with pepperonis, which was good but not particularly great. The meatballs also tasted like any other meatballs. It was nice to eat by the pier though, but not worth waiting in line for."
Katey G.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Jul 17, 2023","I stand by my last review from two years ago. Thin, chewy crust with a light layer of toppings - the kind of pizza I happen to like a lot. We got pickup from Juliana's this week for the first time in a long time. We got a half white pizza, half Margherita, with sausage and onions. The total was $41 which was a little surprising.I like Juliana's, but I don't love it. And to be fair, I've only ever gotten takeout. Maybe next time I'll commit to dining in."
Lloyd C.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"Jul 10, 2023","We visited NYC back in 2018, we were walking around DUMBO and my wife saw Juliana's, which was on her list of places to eat at. We stood in line about 30 minutes. Not too bad :/We ordered half with #3mozzarella, sausage, broccoli Rabe & Garlic. The other half was Margherita with sausage. It came out quickly and was piping hot. Thin crust was nice and chewy not dry and crunchy. The toppings were delicious. The atmosphere of the busy place was that people were deeply enjoying their pizza and the company they were with!"
Wil S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Aug 21, 2023",One must research Patsy Grimaldi and history of the location to fully understand my joy of this establishment existing. Is there another pizza establishment better at representing NYC style pie?! Most likely not. I've been visiting Grimaldi's (pre-Juliana's) and Juliana's ever since living in the area. This is on my top 5 American pizzerias in the states. Skip Grimaldi (venture capital chain) next door and eat here for authentic Grimaldi's pizza. Always get the Margherita with fresh garlic on your pizza then go from there.
Taylor Z.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Aug 27, 2023",Good not great. The pizzas came out fresh out of the oven and the ingredients were decent. At the price point and history expected more but it is one of the only remaining coal fired places. The wait can be long but if you come when it opens at 1130 you'll be fine to get seated.
Grace L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 17, 2023","When in NYC, You have to get pizza! One of my favorite pizza place in NYC is Julianas! I went with my Husband and got a large half white and half margherita and a bottle of wine. It was enough for two BUT if we were super hungry, we would love ordered another small pie or a side! Also do not be fooled by the lines - they move pretty quickly. It looked long so we were going to head to another place but we ended up waiting only 15 minues or so. Highly recommend!! Also, They need give Jamal a raise - He was our server and honestly he made Julianas 200% better. His service and his smile was excellent!"
Lena S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Oct 13, 2023","There is alway a line outside to get in. Luckily it was moving relatively fast. There is not much space inside or outside. The service was very fast and quite good. Unfortunately by the time we got it some items on the menu were not available.Margarita pizza was good, the other one- special pizza number 1 was not, it was just ok."
Sandy D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Sep 28, 2023","So delicious a guy was even broadcasting his meal live when we were there!The place was super packed, even on a weeknight. But we luckily beat the rush for a table of 2. For the Classics, you can mix and match. So we went with the Medium Half Margherita Half White Pizza ($25.50), with sausage and fennel (+$6) as toppings for the White pizza. The pizza came super quick. I don't think it came extremely hot unfortunately. Both were great, but I prefer the classic tomato base, especially when the tomato sauce tasted so fresh! Both had an easy to eat, slightly crispy crust. Like all pizza pies, the heat beats us before we finish, and we're left with cold pizza at the end. I really wish we could just pop them in the oven again! The toppings are pricey, but from trying the sausage and fennel which were delicious, I think they could be worth adding in. Check this notable place out whenever you're in the area!"
K I.,"Yorba Linda, CA",5 star rating,"Oct 29, 2023","Came here twice during our vk, it was that good. More in the craft pizza category than classic, the pizza delivered. Order ""well done"" for a crispy crust. We got sausage the first time and the white pie with sweet onions the second, both are a must. Their vanilla egg cream is out of control, so is their root-beer float. Cappuccino on point. Excellent service. There is always a line 10-20 min but worth it. Super cute on the inside, the waitstaff does not make you feel rushed in the slightest. Loveeeee"
Gwen P.,"Yonkers, NY",4 star rating,"Sep 2, 2023","Awesome place. Husband, his family from Italy (3), and I arrived at 3:50ish to a line waiting for the 4:00 reopening of the restaurant. Fate wanted us to get seated during the first wave of crowd in the evening because it grew as the minutes went by and even after we finished our zas and left the perimeter. The place was very bustling even as we waited to get in. It got very crowded very quick, but it was handled well, efficiently, and the guy doing the head counts did a great job sitting us and everyone else. Interesting to know the history of Juliana's and the next door Grimaldi's! (Someone wrote it out down here and you can google as well). I went to Grimaldi's ten years ago with cousins so had to try this 4.5star-er obviously and ask what the Italian family thought of NY style pizza lmao. They loved it! There's definitely that char taste that's included that someone here wrote about that will or will not be your cup of tea. Personally, I don't care much for the wood oven taste, but it's appreciated when I do come across such a place. The tartness of the tomato sauce on the margherita was *chef's kiss*, and so was the not tomatoey at all-scallion pancetta no. 1. They're both equally tasty to me.I do gotta say it's easy to get thirsty when you're chomping down delicious pizza. I know it's Brooklyn, and the sodas are a little more special because they're the ones that are imported (or well at least I hope they are) and come in bottles, but I am still so dehydrated after spending that much on a drink. ($4-$5) Can y'all like. Get generic soda so this isn't a problem? Hehe. Just kidding. Be quenched with a nice icy tap if you're a little frugal like me."
Jessica W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"Oct 9, 2023","Juliana's Pizza had a line out their door before their doors open for the evening, which we stood in line for. Even though we only wanted take out we still stood in line. The line moved relatively quickly though. Unfortunately, they do not sell by the slice and only per pie. They also do not have pepperoni pizza, but you can add-on pepperoni to an existing pizza, so that's what we did. We got a Margherita pizza with pepperonis and a side of meatballs. Honestly, for the size of the pizza relative to how much we paid (Over $20!), I was kind of disappointed. They could have definitely put more pepperonis too, they really skimped out on it. The pizza tasted like a normal NYC margherita pizza with pepperonis, which was good but not particularly great. The meatballs also tasted like any other meatballs. It was nice to eat by the pier though, but not worth waiting in line for."
Katey G.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Jul 17, 2023","I stand by my last review from two years ago. Thin, chewy crust with a light layer of toppings - the kind of pizza I happen to like a lot. We got pickup from Juliana's this week for the first time in a long time. We got a half white pizza, half Margherita, with sausage and onions. The total was $41 which was a little surprising.I like Juliana's, but I don't love it. And to be fair, I've only ever gotten takeout. Maybe next time I'll commit to dining in."
Lloyd C.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"Jul 10, 2023","We visited NYC back in 2018, we were walking around DUMBO and my wife saw Juliana's, which was on her list of places to eat at. We stood in line about 30 minutes. Not too bad :/We ordered half with #3mozzarella, sausage, broccoli Rabe & Garlic. The other half was Margherita with sausage. It came out quickly and was piping hot. Thin crust was nice and chewy not dry and crunchy. The toppings were delicious. The atmosphere of the busy place was that people were deeply enjoying their pizza and the company they were with!"
Wil S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Aug 21, 2023",One must research Patsy Grimaldi and history of the location to fully understand my joy of this establishment existing. Is there another pizza establishment better at representing NYC style pie?! Most likely not. I've been visiting Grimaldi's (pre-Juliana's) and Juliana's ever since living in the area. This is on my top 5 American pizzerias in the states. Skip Grimaldi (venture capital chain) next door and eat here for authentic Grimaldi's pizza. Always get the Margherita with fresh garlic on your pizza then go from there.

Amrita A.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Sep 19, 2023","Salma was quite the experience- the owner/manager seemed in a bit of a mood so maybe we went on an off day- I don't know. But it definitely threw all of us off. We were a party of 4.To start he said we could bring our own bottle of wine (BYOB) but we ""had"" to each order a main. To which we agreed. When we got ready to order he picked out what we could order from the main and what we could not (salads NO, sandwiches NO, big platters YES). He came off as a little harsh and I think he realized so he said he will throw in a free Kebab. Okay great, but then why not just let us order a sandwich? Anyway, it doesn't end there. When we decided to go get a second bottle of wine he simply refused saying he cannot hold up the table. To give perspective, the entire restaurant was empty.Rude, insensitive, inconsistent and plain off-putting. Food was nothing great to write home about either. And we ordered a lot!"
S. Anne T.,"Santa Clara, CA",4 star rating,"Sep 5, 2023",Ordered on Uber eats.Did the BOGO deal for the filet sandwich. It was pretty good. Will get it again. Delivery- did not follow all directions on order but overall it came out ok. Would order the sandwich again. Great for a Quick meal. Also ordered the eggplant dip - it was not anything to write home about. So def skip that if you're eyeing it.
Anamika K.,"East Elmhurst, NY",4 star rating,"Jun 13, 2023","The only thing redeeming about this place was the ambience, the spicy potatoes and the hummus. Decorated in a super cute way with lots of plants and cute lamps, it gives off a very homely rustic vibe. Overall the food could be better! We ordered the chicken and lamb dishes and while the portions were amazingly big, the food could've been seasoned better. The falafel wrap was average and the fries were good but also heavily seasoned. The potatoes were a redeeming quality. Would definitely get the potatoes starters and just enjoy a meal of sides rather than the main dishes. The service was kind of confusing(?). When we sat down the host was definitely trying to rush us to order and kept coming to our table 2-3 times asking us if we're ready. However, our food took a pretty long time after. Our starters arrived quickly but we had finished them and still had to wait a while before our mains came. Although I can imagine they were busy for a Tuesday night, which is understandable, but then don't rush folks to order?"
Zach K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Oct 21, 2023",Amazing food! The dolmas and appetizer tray was  to die for. Lebanese coffee was also so great. Will definitely be going back!
YingLinn C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Mar 25, 2023","We came in as a big party on a Friday night and it was packed. Definitely make reservations. The place is a cute tiny restaurant, so definitely call for reservations ahead of time. We had a miscommunication with the server and Pierre accommodated and was more than happy to make things right. (Lots of respect for restaurant owners who make their customers happiness a priority).All the appetizers were delicious! The cheesy roll (forgive me I forgot the name) was similar to flaky crispy mozzarella sticks. The meats were savory and had lots of flavor. Overall such a great spot for snacks and food. **best of all, it's BYOB. With EV being a dominant drinking place, it's a great spot to pregame with a bit of food."
Renata G.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"May 11, 2023","All the stars go to friendliness of the people working there. They were sweet, very welcoming and quick to seat and serve us. With that, it definitely built up the expectation of amazing food to go with the service. Unfortunately they didn't match up.The QR scan menu was easy to scroll through with lots of pictures. We wanted to share some light plates since it was already pretty late in the evening. We ordered fattoush salad, moutabal eggplant and falafel sandwich. It all came out pretty quick with a side of pita bread. - salad was overdressed with strong vinegar dressing overwhelming the taste of the vegetables. It unsuccessfully tried to mask old soggy cucumber slices and hard cardboard-like tomato. We didn't finish it- eggplant had an interesting taste to it. At first I liked it but then it started to feel like fake smoke or meat grease mix that gave that aftertaste- falafel sandwich was dry with a stale deli pita around it. I avoided the pita basket after trying to the falafel (didn't take a pic. It was underwhelming)Sad! Wish it was better! Hope it will will improve!"
Myrna C.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Jan 8, 2023","Friends suggested stopping by this place on a Sunday afternoon. I admittedly am not a huge Mediterranean food fan, but others in the group wanted to try so I thought, why not?One of the people in our party wanted to order a side of fries but the owner proposed some sort of alternative where the rest of us somehow lost our fries and yet the other person was still charged for the extra order of fries. I guess we were substituted rice instead? It was all pretty confusing.The bill also came out to be much more than what was on the menu, which seems to be a common occurrence based on other reviews I've read. Food was just okay especially considering the price point though portion size was decent. All in all, will probably not return again considering an abundance of other options in the area."
Mark Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Nov 16, 2022","Lots of mediocre dishes but some tasty ones too. Maybe a bit too pricey for what you can get in Astoria (bz grill for example).  Service was mostly warm and attentive, although at peak hours (6pm and onward), it can get a little slow, especially if you're trying to close out.The pitas, although they were served warm, suffered from a cardboard texture just 5 minutes after hitting the table. Since I eat them with every dish, I was disappointed by this. And even at its freshest, this pita was a little flat and dense.We only ordered 2 dishes, but the chicken shish tawouk was my by far my favorite. It was fairly juicy, with nice grill marks. It also came with very seviceable french fries (light on grease and batter, which is a plus) and flavorful toum sauce (although it doesn't hold a candle to Shukette's toum.We also had the appetizer platter. This was fairly underwhelming in comparison, even though it was recommended by Robert Sietsema from Eater (0/2 on his recommendations recently). The hummus had a nice, clear chickpea flavor and was topped with olive oil and whole chickpea. The stuffed grape leaves were good; filled tight, with enough acidity. The kibbeh plus garlic sauce was the best part of this platter (served hot, with a light shell, and tightly filled). The salad was fine, but the msakaa was underwhelming (there was no clear flavor coming through)."
Glenn C.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"Feb 7, 2023","I was at this Lebanese spot with one of my groups. They are located pretty close to Au Za'atar and Balade but this is more of a casual setting with less stuff on the menu (especially regarding mezze) but with somewhat similar prices. As this group doesn't tend to share (begrudgingly,) we got separate meals though I would probably recommend getting the mixed platter if you're in a group as it is a much better deal than the rest of the menu. I would describe the service in the most polite sense as gruff. I'm not sure if he woke up on the wrong side of the bed but I didn't find him friendly and we spent a good chunk of change so he could have been a bit nicer.I started with the Batata Harra or fried potatoes with spices which was $11.95. The potatoes had a pretty good fry but they were less spiced then many of the other better varieties I've tried. It was alright and mostly worth it for the price but as noted I've had better. I tried the Foul (or ful medames,) which is more common in Egypt but their version was fine. I also tried the Kibbeh which was fine as well.As I was likely planning on taking leftovers home, I went with the Mixed Grill which had three kabobs for $38.50. This consisted of veal, shish taouk, and kabob halabi which is strange because both the first (veal) and last (halabi) kabobs don't even exist on the rest of the menu. It was served on top of bread and came with some rice, garlic whip (AKA toum,) and some mixed vegetables (which by the photos was a grilled tomato, grilled pepper, and grilled onion.) The veal looked more like lamb though it was less tender. The chicken/shish taouk (or tawook) in the middle was similarly a bit bland needing the toum. The kabob halabi was essentially kofta and was easily the best of the meats being pretty tender and quite flavorful but would just be passable at most other spots. The rice on the side both lacked the golden raisins listed in the photo and was undercooked and rather terrible and the dish also lacked the grilled onion shown in the photo. For around $40, this was not worth it (and frankly laughable with the rice.) I tried the lamb shawarma which was a lot tastier, the lamb kabob which was better (so I guess it was veal,) and essentially gave the rest of my toum to another person who was having a dry shish tawouk wrap. I'm not sure if I caught this place on a bad day but it's hard for me to find anything really positive about this spot at least from what I ordered. The best stuff was only good because the rest was bad and the passable food would be just alright in a good Lebanese spot. I understand if this place was comparatively cheaper than the other sit-down spots nearby but it wasn't. Go to Au Za'atar where the food is just better at a slightly higher price and the service is nicer. I don't get the reviews at all as everything was under-spiced or under-cooked. 2 at best."
